# DHT-simulations-misinformation-propagation
A github for my project and masters thesis, which is on the propagation of misinformation. 
This repository contains all code used for the project thesis delivered on 21.06.2025.

## Project thesis: "Beliefs and the propagation ofmisinformation in social networks"

The plots used in the project thesis paper are in the plots folder. 
The code used to produce the results shown in the plots lies in:

DHT_main_simulation_file.py

The code is commented, but retains a lot of "old artifacts" no longer in use. Throughout the summer of 2025 redundant lines and functions might be removed, and readability might be improved, but the functional code used to produce results will stay untouched.

To produce the data on your own, simply follow the instructions in the method section of the paper and edit the parameters in the code accordingly.
